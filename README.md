## Description
# What is the app for?
To build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable. I'll need to write a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Strategy 
| Steps | Instructions | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| Installation Requirements | npm i inquirer - Completed |

| Prompt window requires you to enter team managers name, employee ID, email address, and office number | Completed |
| When prompted with team manager information, then i am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team | Completed |
| Engineer Selection:  I am prompted to enter the engineer’s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu | Completed |
